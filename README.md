# Yellow Quackling Productions
Yellow Quackling production is a multiplayer online battle arena video game based in Java.

## Getting started
In all game modes, players control characters called 'warrior', chosen or assigned every match, who each have a set of unique abilities. Warriors begin every match and then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a victory. Gaining warrior victory in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character.

### Prerequisites
Each player should create an account to play.<br> 
Registration form is realized in separate web application based in Spring MVC.
